      "question": "Describe about phylum Mollusca",
      "correct_answer": "The bilateral symmetry and the triploblastic nature of the body layers are seen here too. Molluscans form a very diverse group and form an important part of the ecosystem. These animals can be seen aquatic habitats. They can be either marine or freshwater species. The body does not show much segmentation and the coelomic cavity is also reduced. The body is typically divided into anterior head, ventral muscular foot, and a dorsal visceral mass. The foot helps in the locomotion of the animals. Examples are Snails, Mussels, and Octopus."

      "question": "Briefly describe the Light Reaction of Photosynthesis (or) Light-dependent Reaction",
      "correct_answer": "Photosynthesis begins with the light reaction which is carried out only during the day in the presence of sunlight. In plants, the light-dependent reaction takes place in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. The Grana, membrane-bound sacs like structures present inside the thylakoid functions by gathering light and is called photosystems. These photosystems have large complexes of pigment and proteins molecules present within the plant cells, which play the primary role during the process of light reactions of photosynthesis. There are two types of photosystems: photosystem I and photosystem II. Under the light-dependent reactions, the light energy is converted to ATP and NADPH, which are used in the second phase of photosynthesis. During the light reactions, ATP and NADPH are generated by two electron-transport chains, water is used, and oxygen is produced."
