The major part of the system is Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based mind maps generator.
This will help the student to find sub lesson chapters deeply and more efficiently and generate mind maps
relevant to the lectures more interactively that enhance students to memorize the lesson more efficiently.
(example: when the student upload a lecture/lesson, this system will understand the content of that lecture/lesson and generate a mind map or short note related to it) 

Specific Objectives 
 
Enhance the students’ memorizing level and provide short notes relevant to their lessons with the help of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning based mind maps generator.
•Identify and gather relevant sub lesson chapters deeply and more efficiently with help of web scraping, AI, and ML.
•Generate the mind maps relevant to the lectures more interactively that enhance students to memorize the lesson more efficiently.
•This makes complex ideas easier to understand and this helps students to remember and recall information.

METHODOLOGY

Students can upload lectures/lessons to the system.
Then AI tool helps understand the content of the uploaded lecture and generate a related mind-map with the help of ontology mind map, semantic web and owl technologies.
User can view the mind map and also it will be stored in a cloud storage.
